# Clickable Computer Parts

This is my first project using **HTML and CSS**, just an exercise with the parts of my own computer.  
I'm still learning, so please ignore any mistakes. ðŸ˜Š

## About
The project shows my computer and its components as **clickable links**, turning each part into an interactive element.

## Technologies
- HTML  
- CSS  

## Notes
This is only a learning exercise and not meant to be a professional project.
